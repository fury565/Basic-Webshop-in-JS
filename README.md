Basic concept of how a single page webshop should function.

User should be able to add any item currently available to the cart and specify the amount.

Accessing the cart should give him the information on what items he already added and
should provide the option to remove them from the cart.
Also cart should display the total cost of all items combined.

In case there are too many items available in the shop, there should be either name or
categorical search option to help users find specific items faster.
